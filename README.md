<h1 align="center">Course Enrollment Guidance Chatbot 🤖</h1>
<h2 align="center"><i>Python Based Chatbot</i></h2>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>📍<b><i>The Problem we aim to solve</i></b>
<ul>University students often face difficulty in selecting appropriate courses each semester due to:
o	Complex degree requirements
o	Multiple prerequisite dependencies
o	Limited availability of academic advisors
o	Lack of personalized academic guidance
As a result, students may enroll in unsuitable courses, causing:
o	Academic failure
o	Delayed graduation
o	Increased workload stress
This project proposes an AI-based Course Enrollment Guidance Chatbot that intelligently analyzes a student’s academic profile and recommends suitable courses and career-aligned guidance.</ul>
📍<b><i> •	Importance of Problem</i></b>
<ul><i>o	Academic relevance: Helps students make informed course enrollment decisions
o	Institutional relevance: Reduces dependency on manual academic advising
o	Societal relevance: Improves graduation rates and academic planning
o	Industrial relevance: Similar AI advisors are used in modern LMS and EdTech platforms

<ul><i>Game Board:</i> Displays the snake, fruit, and the grid for gameplay.</ul>
<ul><i>Side Panel:</i> Shows game statistics and controls for user guidance.</ul>
📍<b><i> Event-Driven Programming</i></b>
<ul>The game responds to keyboard inputs for snake movement and game controls.</ul>
<ul>The Login form reacts to user credentials using event listeners.</ul>
<ul>Action listeners and key listeners are used to trigger game events.</ul>
📍<b><i> Real-Time Game Mechanics</i></b>
<ul>The Clock class manages the game cycle, ensuring smooth animations and movement.</ul>
<ul>The SnakeGame class handles the logic for movement, collision detection, and scoring.</ul>
<ul>The BoardPanel class is responsible for rendering the game elements.</ul>
<h3>Project Features</h3>
<b>🟢<i> Login Authentication System</i></b>
<ul>Users must enter correct credentials before accessing the game.</ul>
<ul>Simple authentication mechanism (hardcoded credentials for now).</ul>
<b>🟢<i> Interactive Snake Gameplay</i></b>
<ul>Grid-based movement of the snake.</ul>
<ul>The snake grows upon eating fruit.</ul>
<ul>The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the borders.</ul>
<b>🟢<i> Graphical Enhancements</i></b>
<ul>Gradient colors and shading effects for a visually appealing experience.</ul>
<ul>The snake head has eyes indicating its movement direction.</ul>
<ul>The fruit has a gradient effect for a more realistic look.</ul>
<b>🟢<i> Score and Game Statistics</i></b>
<ul><i>Displays:</i></ul>
<ul>Current score</ul>
<ul>Fruits eaten</ul>
<ul>Next fruit score</ul>
<ul>The score increases as the snake eats fruits.</ul>
<b>🟢<i> Multiple Control Options</i></b>
<ul>Players can use WASD or arrow keys for movement.</ul>
<ul>Pause (P) and Resume options.</ul>
<ul>Exit the game using the Escape (Esc) key.</ul>
<b>🟢<i> Game State Management</i></b>
<ul><i>New Game State:</i> Shows a message before the game starts.</ul>
<ul><i>Paused State:</i> Allows players to pause and resume the game.</ul>
<ul><i>Game Over State:</i> Displays a message and prompts the user to restart.</ul>
<b>🟢<i> Optimized Performance</i></b>
<ul>Uses double buffering for smooth rendering.</ul>
<ul>Clock-based cycle handling ensures consistent frame updates.</ul>
